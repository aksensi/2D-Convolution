# 2D-Convolution

## Repository Type: Academic Project

# Project Description
NCSU ECE-558 (Digital Imaging Systems) Project 2
- Instructor: Prof. Tianfu Wu
- Implement 2D convolution from scratch and different type of paddings in Python 
## Dependencies
  - numpy
  - OpenCV
  
## About
- It convolves an input image of choice from the user with a filter of choice. The padding function algorithm is written without using the Python built-in function that does zero/wrap-around/copy-edge/reflect-across-edge padding directly.
- ak_code has the code file which has comments for reference.
